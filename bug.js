This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with certain Android devices. The camera preview fails to render correctly, displaying a blank screen or a distorted image.  This is often observed after upgrading Expo SDK versions or changing device orientations. The error messages logged might not be very descriptive, making it hard to debug immediately. This is especially problematic when using features like barcode scanning which directly depend on the camera preview.
