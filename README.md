# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Issue on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera API fails to render the camera preview correctly on certain Android devices. The issue often appears after an Expo SDK upgrade or a change in device orientation.  The preview might show a blank screen or a distorted image, hindering the functionality of camera-dependent features.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the app using `expo start`.
4. Test on various Android devices. Note that the issue may not appear on all devices.

## Solution

The proposed solution involves using specific camera options to improve the rendering process. This includes setting explicit aspect ratios, using a specific camera type, and ensuring correct permissions. Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for the implementation.
